  <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
  <p><b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted and received across networks, ensuring efficient communication between devices. 
    Their main <b>function</b> is to define rules and formats for how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across networks like the Internet. <br>
    Some common examples of Internet protocols include: <br>
    <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), <br>
    <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol), <br>
    <b>HTTPS</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), <br>
    <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol), <br>
    and <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
  </p>

  <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>

  <p>
    <b>IP addresses</b> are unique numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. They help to identify and locate devices on a network, enabling them to communicate and exchange data. <br><br>
    There are two main versions of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>. <br>
    <b>IPv4</b> uses a 32-bit address format and is the most commonly used version. <br>
    <b>IPv6</b> uses a 128-bit format and is designed to handle the growing number of devices on the Internet. It provides more address space and improved security features, making it suitable for modern networks and the Internet of Things. <br><br>
    Types of IP Addresses include: <b>Public IP addresses</b>, <b>Private IP addresses</b>, <b>Static IP addresses</b>, and <b>Dynamic IP addresses</b>.
